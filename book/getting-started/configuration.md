# Configuration

The last step is to update your OP Stack configuration to use the new `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` contract managed by the `op-succinct-proposer` service.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: All proposed, non-finalized output roots on the `L2OutputOracleProxy` will be automatically finalized after the upgrade to `op-succinct`, as the `finalizationPeriod` is set to 0 by default. For security, we recommend ensuring that all old proposer output roots are correct before upgrading.

## Self-Managed OP Stack Chains

If you are using a self-managed OP Stack chain, you will need to use your `ADMIN` key to update the existing `L2OutputOracle` implementation. Recall that the `L2OutputOracle` is a proxy contract that is upgradeable using the `ADMIN` key.

To update the `L2OutputOracle` implementation, run the following command in `/contracts`:

```bash
forge script script/OPSuccinctUpgrader.s.sol:OPSuccinctUpgrader \
    --rpc-url $L1_RPC \
    --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
    --verify \
    --verifier etherscan \
    --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY \
    --broadcast \
    --ffi
```

## RaaS Providers
